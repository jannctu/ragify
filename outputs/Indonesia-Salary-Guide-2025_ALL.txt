A Guide to Salaries & Trends in the

Labour Market 2025 ;
The Indonesian market stands at a pivotal moment of transformation,

with business sentiment reflecting cautious optimism as the country

enters a new chapter under fresh leadership. While companies

maintain a measured approach to hiring, we’re witnessing significant . .
developments across multiple sectors that signal promising Monico Lim
opportunities ahead.

The industrial manufacturing sector remains a cornerstone of President Director
Indonesia’s economy, influencing various value chains. This strength is

complemented by emerging opportunities in data centres, where local

conglomerates and international players are establishing a presence.

Healthcare infrastructure development shows dynamism, with hospital

construction expanding beyond Jakarta. This expansion, backed by

private equity and venture capital investment, reflects confidence in

Indonesia’s healthcare sector.

The retail landscape is experiencing a notable shift, with Asian brands

and local retail companies drawing substantial venture capital

investment for expansion. Meanwhile, the FMCG sector faces exciting

challenges, particularly in the mid-market segment, as consumer

preferences adapt to economic conditions.

Salary trends remain relatively stable, with typical annual increments

ranging from 5%-8% across industries. However, some sectors, mainly

financial services, offer significant counter-offers to retain key talent,

highlighting the growing competition for skilled professionals.

Infrastructure, manufacturing, and energy sectors are key focus areas

for development and are expected to drive employment opportunities

and economic growth. We anticipate more accessible pathways for

foreign companies to establish operations, creating new opportunities.

For professionals, success depends on strong communication skills,

effective leadership capabilities, and specialised expertise. While many

aspire to generalist leadership roles, specialist career paths can

command attractive compensation while offering deeper expertise.

As Indonesia strengthens its relationships with global partners and

potentially streamlines processes for foreign investment, companies

remain cautiously optimistic about the opportunities ahead. This

balanced outlook, combined with the country's robust domestic market

and potential policy reforms to ease foreign business entry, positions

Indonesia favourably for continued growth and development.
