A Guide to Salaries & Trends in the
Labour Market 2025
The Indonesian market stands at a pivotal moment of transformation,
with business sentiment reflecting cautious optimism as the country
enters a new chapter under fresh leadership. While companies
maintain a measured approach to hiring, we’re witnessing significant Monico Lim
developments across multiple sectors that signal promising
opportunities ahead.
President Director
The industrial manufacturing sector remains a cornerstone of
Indonesia’s economy, influencing various value chains. This strength is
complemented by emerging opportunities in data centres, where local
conglomerates and international players are establishing a presence.
Healthcare infrastructure development shows dynamism, with hospital
construction expanding beyond Jakarta. This expansion, backed by
private equity and venture capital investment, reflects confidence in
Indonesia’s healthcare sector.
The retail landscape is experiencing a notable shift, with Asian brands
and local retail companies drawing substantial venture capital
investment for expansion. Meanwhile, the FMCG sector faces exciting
challenges, particularly in the mid-market segment, as consumer
preferences adapt to economic conditions.
Salary trends remain relatively stable, with typical annual increments
ranging from 5%-8% across industries. However, some sectors, mainly
financial services, offer significant counter-offers to retain key talent,
highlighting the growing competition for skilled professionals.
Infrastructure, manufacturing, and energy sectors are key focus areas
for development and are expected to drive employment opportunities
and economic growth. We anticipate more accessible pathways for
foreign companies to establish operations, creating new opportunities.
For professionals, success depends on strong communication skills,
effective leadership capabilities, and specialised expertise. While many
aspire to generalist leadership roles, specialist career paths can
command attractive compensation while offering deeper expertise.
As Indonesia strengthens its relationships with global partners and
potentially streamlines processes for foreign investment, companies
remain cautiously optimistic about the opportunities ahead. This
balanced outlook, combined with the country's robust domestic market
and potential policy reforms to ease foreign business entry, positions
Indonesia favourably for continued growth and development.
